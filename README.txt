The Oubliette Within: A Game for Ludum Dare 29
==============================================

In The Oubliette Within, you play a person working through his hidden fears.  This game was created for Ludum Dare #29.  The original version was created for the Jam, but using the Compo restrictions (all code and content created in 72 hours by me).  This is version 2.0, with lots of improvements.
