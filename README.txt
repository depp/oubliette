The Oubliette Within: A Game for Ludum Dare 29
==============================================

Who reads these README files anyway?

This was done under the stricter Compo rules: all code and content was created during the jam, except I took 72 hours instead of 48.  I was planning on entering the Compo, but the game just wasn't there when the deadline rolled around.
