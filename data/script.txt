@ prologue
P: Tell me, what are you afraid of?
I: I'm afraid of spiders.
P: Really?
I: Sort of.
P: Go deeper.  Beneath the surface,
   you can find your true fears.

@ lose
P: Perhaps we should try a different
   approach.

@ childhood_intro
P: Tell me about your childhood.
I: Oh, college.

@ childhood_1
P: So you found it hard to connect.
I: Yeah, I was two thousand miles
   from home, and making friends is
   impossible.

@ childhood_2
P: So you didn't really see the
   point.
I: I was a history major, and I knew
   I'd end up working in fast food.

@ childhood_3
P: So you felt like you didn't
   belong.
I: Heh.  I can't believe I faked it
   for so many years.

@ childhood_4
P: Hm, I think we should move on.
I: Yeah, ancient history.

@ love_intro
P: What about your love life?
I: Of course.  Her.

@ love_1
P: So you might be rushing in?
I: I don't know if I love her, but
   this could be my last chance.

@ love_2
P: So you don't think it will last?
I: I've had some rough breakups
   before.  This is no fairy tale.

@ love_3
P: So you don't think she
   understands you?
I: Heh.  It's a good thing.  If she
   knew the real me, she would have
   left long ago.

@ love_4
P: Hm, it seems to be working out
   for you.
I: Yeah, well, we're making it work.

@ death_intro
P: I heard that one of your friends
   passed away.
I: Best friend.

@ death_1
P: So, it made you think about
   death?
I: I can see the future, and there
   will be nobody at my funeral.

@ death_2
P: So there aren't others like him?
I: He was the only person who ever
   got me.

@ death_3
P: So you don't like the way you
   grieved?
I: Ungh.  Why didn't I cry?

@ death_4
P: Hm, a difficult time.
I: Yeah, well, ups and downs.

@ epilogue
P: Have you learned anything about
   your fears?

@ epilogue_0
I: No!  I mean, I don't know.  I'm
   not sure.
P: Perhaps we should talk some more.
T: [Try again.]

@ epilogue_1
I: Here I am, alone, in a city of
   millions.
T: [Your fear: being alone.]

@ epilogue_2
I: Is it worth it?  To keep trying?
T: [Your fear: disappointment.]

@ epilogue_3
I: If they knew what I was really
   like...
T: [Your fear: being an impostor.]

@ epilogue_4
I: I think I've learned more about
   courage.
T: [You have accepted your fears.]
